### Task Three: Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Sentiment Analysis of Flipkart Product Reviews

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews for the "YONEX MAVIS 350 Nylon Shuttle" on Flipkart. The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative** and extract insights from negative feedback to identify common customer pain points. This information can guide product improvements.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Dataset:**  
   A collection of 8,518 reviews with attributes like Rating, Review Text, Up Votes, and Down Votes.

2. **Model Selection:**  
   - For faster training and decent accuracy: **Naive Bayes with Bag-of-Words (BOW).**  
   - For higher accuracy: **Logistic Regression with BERT** or **Random Forest with TF-IDF.**

3. **Final Recommendation:**  
   - **Logistic Regression with BERT** is the best choice for deployment, offering high accuracy (F1 score), efficient training times, and minimal latency.  
     This makes it ideal for practical applications where performance and efficiency are critical.

### Task Four: Computer Vision - Image Classification Using MNIST Dataset

This project applies computer vision techniques to the **MNIST dataset**, a widely-used dataset of handwritten digits. The objective is to classify digits (0-9) based on their pixel values, enabling machines to recognize handwritten numbers accurately.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Dataset:**  
   The MNIST dataset includes 372000  images with  each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **Approach:**  
   Train a machine learning model to identify digits based on image data.

3. **Outcome:**  
   Develop a model capable of high accuracy in digit recognition for potential applications in digit-based automation.
